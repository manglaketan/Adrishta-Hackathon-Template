## Team Number \<Your Team Number> - \<Your Project Name>

The participants are required to fork this repository and create a public Github repository under their own username (Single repository per team). *Clone the repo on your local system and build on top of that*

The following created sections in this README.md need to be duly filled, highlighting the denoted points for the solution/implementation. 

**Please feel free to create further sub-sections in this markdown.** The idea is to understand all the particulars of your solution in a singular document.

### Project Overview

A brief description of 
* What problem did the team try to solve?
-I have tried to solve the second Check&Mate problem of Aryan, by creating a chess game for him to practice on.

* What is the proposed solution?
-The best solution is Aryan compete with himself from both the sides and observe what are his mistakes and how can he counter each and every move of his opponent.


### Solution Description

Explain your solution to the problem in detail here.
-To make it easier for him, I have suggested all possible moves that a chess piece at a particular moment of time can move. I have also created administrator mode(Password==Project) where he can view the result of his game and understand where he went wrong. THen there is a player mode where he can play against himself or anyone else as well. This allows him to improve his game and practice solo so that he doesn't even feel demoralised even if he looses a game to computer.
